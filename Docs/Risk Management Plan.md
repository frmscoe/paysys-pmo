# Risk Management Plan

## Introduction
This document serves as a structured risk management plan for tracking and managing potential risks associated with the project. It outlines key risks, their impact, likelihood, and proposed mitigation strategies to ensure proactive risk management.
By maintaining this structured risk log, the team fosters **transparency** in risk handling, enabling **informed decision-making** to mitigate potential project delays and challenges. Regular reviews and monitoring ensure that high-priority risks are addressed promptly, allowing for **effective collaboration** and timely interventions to minimize disruptions.
## Risk Identification
Risk identification will be conducted in alignment with the Risk Management Plan, engaging the project team and relevant stakeholders. This process will include a comprehensive assessment of the Project Management Plan, specifically evaluating the project scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Additionally, thorough analysis will be applied to project deliverables, assumptions, constraints, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), resource allocation strategy, and other critical project documentation to ensure proactive risk mitigation.
## Risk Logging & Tracking
All identified **Risks, Assumptions, Issues, or Dependencies** will be systematically recorded in the [Asana RAID](https://app.asana.com/1/9283783873717/project/1209497261723580/list/1209497280037568) Log to ensure structured tracking and proactive management.
Risks should be logged immediately upon identification to facilitate timely assessment and mitigation.
Each risk entry must include the following key details:
- **Title** - Name of RAID Item.
- **Risk Category** - Log item would be categorized as **Risks, Assumptions, Issues, or Dependencies**.
- **Impact Level** – Categorized as High, Medium, or Low based on potential consequences.
- **Target Resolution Date** - Tentative targeted date for risk resolution.
- **Likelihood** – Assessed as High, Medium, or Low to determine probability.
- **Mitigation Plan** – A planned course of action to minimize or eliminate the risk.
- **Email Address** – Email address of the Risk logger.

### **Risk Logging Responsibility**
- **Risk Logging:** Any team member, stakeholder, project manager, or risk owner involved in the project can log a risk. Alternatively, they can directly inform the responsible project manager, [Usama Abdul Mannan](https://github.com/UsamaAbdulMannan), who will record it in the [Asana RAID Log](https://form.asana.com/?k=iXdBzbtUYF-VQAlFquQuVw&d=9283783873717) for tracking and mitigation.


## Risk Analysis 
All identified risks will be thoroughly assessed to evaluate their potential impact on the project. The assessment will help determine the range of possible project outcomes and enable prioritization based on their level of importance.
###  Qualitative Risk Analysis 
The **probability** and **impact** of each identified risk will be evaluated with input from the project team, using the following classification:
#### **Likelihood Assessment** 
- **High** – Greater than **70%** probability of occurrence.
- **Medium** – Between **30%** and **70%** probability of occurrence.
- **Low** – Below **30%** probability of occurrence.
#### **Impact Assessment** 
| Impact Level | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **High (H)** | Risk has the potential to significantly impact project milestone, schedule, or deliverable. |
| **Medium (M)** | Risk may cause minor disruptions to project milestone, schedule, or deliverable. |
| **Low (L)** | Risk is expected to have minimal impact on project milestone, schedule, or deliverable. |
### Quantitative Risk Analysis
Analysis of risk events that have been prioritized using the qualitative risk analysis process and their affect on project activities will be estimated, a numerical rating is applied to each risk based on quantitative analysis, and then documented in this section of the risk management plan.
## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategy
| Impact | Likelihood | Action Plan |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| High   | High      | Immediate mitigation discussion in daily stand-up. If no mitigation plan, determine if risk acceptance is viable. |
| High   | Medium    | Discuss in weekly meetings, define mitigation plan within TAT. |
| Medium | High      | Discuss in weekly meetings, define mitigation plan within TAT. |
| Medium | Medium    | Monitor and address as necessary. |
| Low    | Low       | Accept the risk; no mitigation plan required. |


### **Critical Risk Action Plan**
- Critical risks will be flagged in the [4 Blockers](https://github.com/frmscoe/pmo/blob/main/Reference%20Docs/4%20Blockers%20Format.png) Report, which is sent out on a weekly basis to ensure visibility and timely resolution.

## Risk Ownership & Responsibility
Below is the structured approach that ensures clear ownership, accountability, and alignment with project goals:
- Each identified risk will be assigned a **Primary Owner** who is accountable for its assessment and mitigation.
- For a risk with **high probability** of occurrence & high impact, if no mitigation plan is established, it must be explicitly documented whether the risk is being accepted.
- Risk-related decisions should be aligned with project objectives and reviewed periodically to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.

## Risk Reporting 
This section  provides a structured approach to risk management, ensuring effective tracking and mitigation of potential project risks throughout the project lifecycle. 

Each column serves a specific purpose to ensure risks are effectively managed and tracked. The description of each column listed below:

- **Risk ID:** A unique identifier for each risk.
- **Defined Risks:** A short description of the risk.
- **Impact:** Categorized as High, Medium, or Low based on the severity of the risk.
- **Likelihood:** The probability of occurrence, marked as High, Medium, or Low.
- **Mitigation Plan:** The steps required to address or reduce the impact of the risk.
- **Risk Owner:** The individual or team responsible for managing the risk.
- **Target Resolution Date:** The expected timeline for resolving the risk.
- **Current Status:** The progress of risk mitigation (Pending, In Progress, or Resolved).
- **Asana RAID Log:** Direct links to **[Asana RAID](https://app.asana.com/1/9283783873717/project/1209497261723580/list/1209497280037568)**  tasks allow seamless updates and monitoring of mitigation actions.
